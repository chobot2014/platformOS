# platformOS
Operating System written in typescript

Untested!
I can build a binary, and I set up the grub config,
but grub-mkrescueiso or whatever it doesn't work on the windows subsystem for linux
(assumes that you are using linux with grub already pointing to like /boot or whatever)



to build follow allong with notes.md
